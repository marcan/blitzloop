# Blitzloop aka 'proper karaoke experience'

Blitzloop is a karaoke software written to replicate the [karaoke experience you
might get in Japan][jsmax]. Screen is dedicated to displaying video and lyrics, while
control is provided remotely (via browser). Please note that watered down alcohol
drinks are not included.

While it is already quite usable, blitzloop remins a work in progress and
requires some manual effort to [install and use][install]. You also need to
prepare your own songs for it.
